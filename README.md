# WC301 Welding Cart

The WC301 Welding Cart is a portable three shelf cart designed to hold the [Everlast PowerTIG 255EXT](https://www.everlastgenerators.com/product/tig-stick/powertig-255ext), [Everlast Power Cool W300](https://www.everlastgenerators.com/product/power-cool-w300-240v) water cooler, and 80 or 125 Cu. Ft. argon cylinder. Locking casters make this cart easy to move around the shop, yet prevent it from rolling out of position. Two side brackets conveniently store the TIG torch and ground clamp when not in use, and can also hold an extension cord for the welder. The top shelf of the cart can be used as a table to place hand tools and other shop items while working. The foot pedal can be placed behind the water cooler for storage.

_Considering this cart is specifically designed for the Everlast PowerTIG 255EXT, there is plenty of clearance to connect the gas hose to the welder. This is an issue with some other welding carts._

Although this cart was designed for the Everlast PowerTIG 255EXT, it may work
with other welders.
